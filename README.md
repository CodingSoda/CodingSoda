### Hey, I'm @CodingSoda!
I am interested in Python and Mathematics, most of my projects will be in Python, none in math, sadly. I am currently learning Python and Math, surprisingly. I am not looking to collaborate on something, as of now. Though you can reach me at my future YouTube channel (not made yet).

CodingSoda/CodingSoda is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

Ahh yes x/x = 1 so 1 is a special repository mm-hmm.
Floor is indeed the floor.
Hey what are you doing, lurking in my source code! >:)
